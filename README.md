# Discord Bot QRCODE
QR codes have become ubiquitous in many countries in the last few years. With the help of bots, QR codes can be generated easily. Through this project, you'll learn how to use Discord bots to turn command arguments into outputs like QR code, without having to look for a QR code generation website.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
The user will send a command in Discord chat with an argument. The argument, converted into the QR code, will later be sent back to the user.
